Hi! this is my term project, Never Getting Over it.

It features a character you launch across different platforms to try to get a high score.
To interact with the player, click and drag on it, and it will be slingshotted in the opposite direction.

To run the project, run main.py. 

No libraries (other than math, I guess) need to be installed.

You can press R to reset the game at any time.

Thank you for downloading my project, I hope you enjoy :)
